## UBTECH Coding Challenges for Software Candidates
This repository has two challenges designed to exercise a candidate's ability to address core competencies, which are a hybrid of programming ability and scientific reasoning.  _Note_: Candidates are encouraged to use the python python code stubs provided, however submissions in other languages will not be unfavorably considered.  Please see the `README` files in the individual folders for more information about each challenge.

**Good Luck!!**
