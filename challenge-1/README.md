## Coding Challenge 1
### Exploratory Data Visualization

You are given a [text file](challenge-1.txt) containing survey data with two columns:  `Age` and `Engagement`.  The `Age` value represents a respondent's age (in years) and the `Engagement` value is some dimensionless measure of how engaged the respondent was to the survey topic.  The `Age` values may look a bit strange given the precision, but just go with it! 

Your task is to read in the data in python (or, if you prefer, your language of choice) and generate a two-dimensional scatterplot of that data.  As in many problems in data analysis, the integrity of the raw data cannot be ensured completely so your solution must be robust to bad/incomplete data entries.  DO NOT MODIFY THE TEXT FILE!

You should plan on spending between one-half and one hour on this challenge.

If you have the time or desire, provide either code comments or a separate text file that discussed your observation regarding how the data is clustered.  Are there any interesting trends?
