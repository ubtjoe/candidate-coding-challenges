## Coding Challenge 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
### Summary

You are given a [text file](challenge-1.txt) containing survey data with two columns:  `Age` and `Engagement`.  The `Age` value represents a respondent's age (in years) and the `Engagement` value is some dimensionless measure of how engaged the respondent was to the survey topic.  The `Age` values may look a bit strange given the precision, but just go with it! 

_If you do not use the python stubs provided, you must provide a separate,  _complete_, set of instructions for building and running your solution.  Failure to do so will result in an automatic fail._

### Challenge Requirements

* read data, line-by-line, from included challenge-1.txt - do not modify the text file!  _THE MAIN POINT OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO WRITE THE CODE THAT READS IN THE DATA PROPERLY; DO NOT JUST USE A LIBRARY FUNCTION LIKE MATLAB'S importdata_!__
* make a 2d scatterplot of the data with axes clearly-labeled
* Analyze the data: Are there any interesting data trends present?  What are they?  _Add your solution as comments to the end of challenge-1.py_

#### Design Considerations
While building your solution, you should consider the following:

* Is your solution appropriate for the task-at-hand?  Have you chosen the right language/tool?
* Is your code readable/well-organized?
* Is your intended design clear?  If not, have you included comments to help the user?
* Is your code flexible/reusable?

You should plan on spending between one-half and one hour on this challenge.
