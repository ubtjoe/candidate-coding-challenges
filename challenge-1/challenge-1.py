# FEEL FREE TO ADD/MODIFY THE IMPORTS - keep in mind you will need to plot the data
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # TODO: read in the data
    with open('challenge-1.txt', 'r') as f:
        # read in the data here
        pass

    # TODO: plot the data - are there any interesting trends present?
